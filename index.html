    <h1>Static Web App</h1>
    <p> Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository.</p>
    <p>
      The workflow of Azure Static Web Apps is tailored to a developer's daily workflow. Apps are built and deployed based on code changes.

      When you create an Azure Static Web Apps resource, Azure interacts directly with GitHub or Azure DevOps, to monitor a branch of your choice. Every time you push commits or accept pull requests into the watched branch, a build automatically runs and your app and API deploys to Azure.

      Static web apps are commonly built using libraries and web frameworks like Angular, React, Svelte, Vue, or Blazor where server side rendering isn't required. These apps include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image assets that make up the application. With a traditional web server, these assets are served from a single server alongside any required API endpoints.
